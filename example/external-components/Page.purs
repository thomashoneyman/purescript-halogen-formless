          In Formless, you can freely leverage external components and embed them in the form. This form shows how to use custom typeahead components built with Select from CitizenNet. This form also demonstrates how you can manipulate forms in Formless. Try selecting an email address, then a whiskey. You'll notice that changing your whiskey selection also clears the selected email.

          Next, try opening the console. If you submit the form with invalid values, Formless will show you your errors. If you submit a valid form, you'll see Formless just returns the valid outputs for you to work with.
