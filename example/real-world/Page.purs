          This component demonstrates building a large form with complex rendering and validation requirements. Notice how both tabs end up unifying to a single output type after the two forms are combined, how various dropdowns determine the contents (and visibility) of other form elements, the assorted external components, and how validation for many fields depends on the values of other fields in the form.
