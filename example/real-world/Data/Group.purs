-- Our primary data type

-- | We'll define our data type as an extensible row. This represents all
-- | the fields that will be shared between our Form data type and our
-- | resulting Group data type.
-- |
-- | Next, we'll define both data types by extending this row in various
-- | ways. The Group type has an ID key and an options object that the form
-- | won't know about when being filled out. And the Form will have two
-- | secret key fields (one for confirmation) whereas the Group type will
-- | have only one, and of a different name altogether.
-- |
-- | In order to be able to define a form, you'll need to leave a type variable
-- | free that takes 3 types as arguments: the error, input, and output types.
-- |
-- | In order for this row to be extensible, you'll need another type variable open
-- | to take possible additional rows
type GroupRow f r =
  ( name         :: f Errs String         String
  , admin        :: f Errs (Maybe Admin)  Admin
  , applications :: f Errs (Array String) (Array String)
  , pixels       :: f Errs (Array String) (Array String)
  , maxBudget    :: f Errs String         (Maybe Int)
  , minBudget    :: f Errs String         Int
  , whiskey      :: f Errs (Maybe String) String
  | r
  )

-- | We'll define proxies for convenience so we can refer to these fields via
-- | lenses and other sorts of things.
_name = SProxy :: SProxy "name"
_admin = SProxy :: SProxy "admin"
_applications = SProxy :: SProxy "applications"
_pixels = SProxy :: SProxy "pixels"
_maxBudget = SProxy :: SProxy "maxBudget"
_minBudget = SProxy :: SProxy "minBudget"
_whiskey = SProxy :: SProxy "whiskey"

-- | Here's the Group data type we'll use throughout our application. After we send
-- | a form result off to the server, this is what we'll get in return on
-- | subsequent form edits.
-- |
-- | Note that we're using the same GroupRow type, but we're filling in `f` with the
-- | Output type provided in the row (the third type on each line), and we're
-- | providing a few new rows.
-- |
-- | Also note that the Group data type relies on another form -- the Options type
-- | from the Options form. With this sort of nesting, we'll use two instances of
-- | Formless.
newtype Group = Group
  ( Record
    ( GroupRow FSpec.Output
      ( id :: GroupId
      , secretKey :: String

derive newtype instance eqGroup :: Eq Group
derive newtype instance showGroup :: Show Group

_id = SProxy :: SProxy "id"
_secretKey = SProxy :: SProxy "secretKey"
_options = SProxy :: SProxy "options"

-- | Here's the Form type we'll use to run with Formless. Again most of the fields are
-- | the same, but just like the Group data type we'll add a few more rows. Unlike that
-- | data type, we need to leave the `f` free for Formless to leverage.
newtype GroupForm f = GroupForm (Record (GroupFormRow f))
derive instance newtypeGroupForm :: Newtype (GroupForm f) _

-- | In order to generate our fields automatically using mkFormSpecFromRow, we'll make
-- | sure to have the new row as a new type.
type GroupFormRow f = GroupRow f
