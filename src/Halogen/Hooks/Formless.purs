-- | Input provided to a `FormField`, which can be used to implement the field.
-- |
-- | - `onChange`: A callback function which should be called when the value of
-- |   the field changes.
-- | - `value`: The current value of this form field in the form state, where
-- |   `Nothing` means the field has not been touched by the user yet.
-- | - `reset`: Set the field back to `Nothing`
type FormFieldInput m i =
  { onChange :: i -> HookM m Unit
  , value :: Maybe i
  , reset :: HookM m Unit
  }

-- | The basic building block of forms, where a Formless form is a record of
-- | `FormField`. A `FormField` is a function from `FormFieldInput` to a Hook
-- | which returns at least an output value (but may also return other, user-
-- | provided fields).
-- |
-- | - `m`: The monad used for for this form field. The monad type must match
-- |   among all form fields in a particular form.
-- | - `h`: The Hook type used for this form field.
-- | - `ro`: A row of any additional fields you wish to include in this form field
-- |   (for example, a rendered form control or error message, a callback function
-- |   to focus the field, and so on).
-- | - `i`: The input type for this form field.
-- | - `o`: The output type for this form field. A form is only considered valid
-- |   when output types are present for all fields in the form.
data FormField m h ro i o = FormField (Proxy m) (FormFieldInput m i -> Hooks.Hook m h { value :: Maybe o | ro })

-- | The interface returned by the `useForm` and `useFormFields` Hooks.
-- |
-- | - `touched`: Whether the user has interacted with any field in the form.
-- | - `fields`: The result value of each `FormField` in the form, which you can
-- |   then use to render or otherwise control your form.
-- | - `form`: The underlying form state for each field in the form.
-- | - `modifyForm`: A callback function which can be used to imperatively modify
-- |   the underlying form state.
-- | - `value`: If all fields have produced an output value, then this contains
-- |   a record of each field's output value.
type FormInterface form m fields value =
  { touched :: Boolean

  :: Hooks.HookNewtype (UseForm form m h) (UseForm' form m h)

-- | A Hook for managing forms with Formless. Combines `useFormState` and
-- | `useFormFields` to manage form state and form fields.
-- |
-- | This Hook requires a function to produce the initial form state and function
-- | to build the set of `FormField`.
-- |
-- | As demonstrated below, typically, you'll provide `\_ -> initialFormState`
-- | for the initial form state and `buildForm { <your form fields> }` to build
-- | the set of `FormField` for the form.
-- |
-- | ```purs
-- | form <- useForm (\_ -> initialFormState) $ buildForm

-- | A Hook for managing form state with Formless. Requires a function to produce

-- |
-- | This Hook is typically used when one field depends on another field's form
