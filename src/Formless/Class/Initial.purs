-- | A type class that provides initial values for form fields. While superficially similar to
-- | Haskell's `Default` type class, this class is only meant for the purposes of defining
-- | initial form values. If you need a default value for a field in your form, you are better
-- | off defining it as a `Maybe` field and providing a default as part of validation.
-- |
-- | In general, if you find yourself reaching for this type class without defining your form
-- | as a row and generating your form spec from it, then you are probably not doing what you intend.
