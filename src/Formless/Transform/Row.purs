-- Construction from rows

-- | A function to transform a row of labels into a InputFields. This allows you
-- | to go directly from a custom form newtype to an inputs record without having to
-- | fill in any values. Requires that all members have an instance of the
-- | `Initial` type class (all monoidal values do by default, along with some
-- | other primitives).
