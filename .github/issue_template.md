## Current behavior

Please include code samples, errors, steps to reproduce, and compiler output if appropriate.

If possible, provide a sample minimal app or test case that reproduces the error. For visual bugs that are difficult to demonstrate in text, consider including a .gif using an app like [Recordit](http://www.recordit.co/).

There are several example components you can use as test cases in the `/example` directory.
